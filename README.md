## Why would I use Terminal Gambler?
Terminal Gambler is a great tool for starting gambling addictions early.

Hell, you don't even have to spend money! Terminal Gambler uses a simulated currency to make sure that you don't spend a dime on your useless child's gambling addiction.

## Where can I get this?
Simply download the most recent release of Terminal Gambler, extract the .zip, open your terminal at the location and do `./terminal_gambler` on Linux and MacOS, or `start terminal_gambler.exe` if you're on Windows. It's not rocket science.

## How do I use it?
If you're talking about after downloading it and you haven't opened it, please talk to your doctor about having dementia, I just fucking said it. If you're talking about it once you've ran the program, type `help` in the terminal.
